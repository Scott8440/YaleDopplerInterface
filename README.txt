Overview
The interface consists of three main components: the front end, which consists of html webpages, javascript programs, and css style sheets. The back end, which consists of mostly python programs which execute the idl doppler code. Thirdly, data transfer between the front end and the back end is mainly handled by javascript and php files.

The interface (including everything but the IDL programs) can be found on Github at https://github.com/Scott8440/YaleDopplerInterface
